# transacta
Agent-based simulation of payments data

## Business Case
* Supervised training approaches to modelling are limited to historical data, which might not contain a rich enough set of patterns (e.g. biases in known methods of financial crime).
* It is difficult to procure and get approval to use real transaction data due to privacy laws like GDPR.
